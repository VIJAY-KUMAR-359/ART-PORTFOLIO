                    The Spiritual Duality—One Form, Two Souls. ---> A masterpiece by EPPILI VIJAY KUMAR ---> Medium: Black Sketch Pen and Oil Pastels on Paper ---> This artwork is a powerful representation of Lord Shiva and Lord Ganesha, merging two divine forms into a single
                    expressive face. Created using a combination of black sketch pen for detailed line work and oil pastels for depth and shading, the piece captures a sense of realism and spiritual symbolism. On the left, the silhouette of Lord Shiva
                    stands boldly with his trident, emerging from the form of Lord Ganesha—his son—whose expressive eye and features dominate the right. The interplay of light and shadow symbolizes the divine balance of destruction and creation, power
                    and wisdom, inviting viewers to pause and reflect on the unity of opposites in the spiritual realm.

                <div class="description ">
                    Divine Innocence – Little Krishna..........Medium: Oil Pastels & Markers ..........This artwork is a heartfelt representation of Lord Krishna as a child, blending realism with vibrant color to capture his playful charm and divine innocence. Created using
                    oil pastels and fine markers, the piece brings out expressive details in Krishna’s eyes, his peacock feather crown, and traditional adornments — all set against a natural outdoor backdrop that enhances the spiritual essence of the
                    piece. The inspiration behind this creation came from a poll I conducted on my Instagram story, where followers were invited to choose between “Cute Little Krishna” and “Lord Shiva” as the next subject. With overwhelming love and support,
                    Little Krishna emerged as the favorite — making this artwork a result of shared sentiment and divine direction.

                <div class="name ">Ardhanari Krishna-Radha</div>
                <div class="description ">
                    This vibrant and symbolic watercolor painting portrays a fusion of Lord Krishna and Radha as a single divine entity, inspired by the concept of Ardhanarishvara — the union of masculine and feminine energies. The left side of the image is Krishna, marked
                    by the blue skin tone, peacock feather, and flute-like adornments, symbolizing divine love, cosmic harmony, and spiritual joy. The right side is Radha, adorned with elegant jewelry, a vibrant pink veil (ghoonghat), and expressive eyes
                    that mirror grace, devotion, and earthly love. Together, this artwork represents unity, balance, and the inseparability of love and divinity, showing how Radha and Krishna are two halves of one eternal soul. The split down the middle
                    emphasizes duality and oneness — a powerful reminder of the sacred balance in the universe. "Two souls, one heart in sacred grace, Krishna and Radha share one face. Divine in love, in hues they blend, A timeless bond that knows no
                    end. "

                <div class="description ">
                    This striking artwork captures the ethereal essence of a white horse galloping through dark waters under a moonless sky. With flowing mane and tail like streaks of wind, the horse symbolizes raw power, purity, and unbound spirit. The contrast between
                    the luminous form and the blackened backdrop evokes a dreamlike presence—like a mythic creature racing through the veil of night. It speaks of freedom, strength, and the beauty of untamed nature meeting the silence of darkness. "When
                    daylight sighs and shadows lean, Golden lamps in silence gleam. Among the trees, where whispers flow, The twilight sings in a pastel glow. "

                <div class="description ">
                    This serene painting captures the quiet charm of a dusky evening as street lamps begin to glow against a cotton-candy sky. Blending hues of lavender, rose, and deepening blue, the sky tells a tale of day's end and night’s gentle approach. The golden lights
                    of the lampposts, standing tall amidst silhouettes of evergreens, seem like watchful sentinels guarding the hush of twilight. It is a moment suspended in peace—where nature and light embrace, and the world exhales softly before darkness
                    settles in.

                <div class="description ">
                    This serene black-and-white sketch captures Lord Krishna in a moment of tender rest. Eyes closed, hand gently supporting his face, and a soft smile playing on his lips, the divine child sits draped in flowing garments, adorned with beads and crowned with
                    his iconic peacock feathers. The artwork radiates peace, innocence, and spiritual stillness—offering a glimpse into the calm divinity of Krishna’s childlike form. It's a tribute to the quiet moments of a deity whose essence is both
                    playful and profound.

                <div class="description ">
                    This vibrant piece of art portrays a poignant moment between two figures — one reaching out to the other in a gesture that blurs the boundary between reality and reflection. The upper figure, adorned in traditional attire with elaborate jewelry and braided
                    hair, leans downward with grace and emotion, touching hands with the mirrored image below. The mirrored figure, richly colored in earthy tones with floral embellishments and a serene expression, symbolizes the soulful connection between
                    two realms — possibly life and afterlife, reality and memory, or two bonded spirits. The use of intense purples and blues in the background creates an ethereal ambiance, enhancing the mystical and emotional depth of the composition.
                    The artwork beautifully combines cultural heritage with spiritual symbolism, inviting the viewer to interpret the connection between the characters through their own lens of imagination and emotion.

                <div class="name ">In Your Shadow – KGF</div>
                <div class="description ">
                    This evocative black-ink sketch pays tribute to a memorable moment from the movie KGF, capturing the quiet intensity of love between Rocky and Reena. Rendered in a minimalist monochrome style, the artwork mirrors the raw emotion and depth seen in the
                    song sequence—where strength meets vulnerability, and silence speaks volumes. The woman leans into Rocky’s back, her expression calm and content, reflecting trust, longing, and unspoken connection. The detailed linework in Rocky’s
                    rugged coat contrasts with the gentle pattern of Reena’s saree, symbolizing their contrasting yet connected worlds. This piece not only echoes the aesthetic of the film but also captures the soul of its storytelling—where even amidst
                    chaos and power, love finds a still place to breathe.

            <p>Hi, I'm a passionate artist whose journey began with pencil sketches and a dream. From a young age, art has been my way of expressing the world around me. While I started with simple sketches, it was in 6th grade that my interest in painting
                truly blossomed. I began exploring various mediums such as oil pastels, watercolors, acrylics, charcoal, and more, constantly pushing my creativity to new heights.</p>


            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>

                    <td>
                        <p>A milestone moment in my journey came in 7th grade, when I won a state-level prize in an art competition. That recognition gave me a huge boost of confidence and inspired me to pursue art with even more dedication. Since then,
                            I’ve participated in numerous art events and competitions, earning certificates, medals, and accolades, including at the national level.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>



            <p>What makes my journey special is that I’ve balanced all this artistic growth alongside my academic life. Whether in school or college, I’ve consistently managed to pursue both my studies and my passion for art with equal dedication. The appreciation
                I've received in both fields has shaped me into a well-rounded individual, always eager to learn and create.</p>
            <p>Art isn't just a hobby for me — it's a part of who I am, and I’m excited to keep evolving as both a student and an artist.

                                  Over the years, I’ve explored traditional and digital mediums—primarily focusing on landscape art and conceptual illustrations.

                              I’ve had the honor of being recognized by several esteemed platforms:
                                    <br>

                            These recognitions reflect my dedication to artistic expression and my commitment to continually evolve as an artist.
                             Through each piece, I aim to convey emotion, atmosphere, and meaning—whether in a quiet rural scene or a bold experimental style.

                                        I’m currently open to collaborations, commissions, and exhibitions, with a vision of using art to inspire, communicate, and bring joy to others.</p>
